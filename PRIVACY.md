# Privacy Policy

## SSE Client Plugin Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes how the SSE Client plugin ("we", "our", or "the plugin") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our plugin with Dify.

### Information We Collect

The SSE Client plugin requires access to the following information:

1. **URL**: The plugin requires a URL to make SSE requests to.
2. **HTTP Headers**: The plugin may require HTTP headers to be sent with requests.
3. **Request Body**: The plugin may require a request body for POST requests.

### How We Use Information

The information collected is used solely for the purpose of:

1. Making SSE (Server-Sent Events) requests to the specified URL.
2. Streaming the response data back to the Dify workflow.

### Data Storage

The SSE Client plugin does not store any user data. All requests are made in real-time and the responses are streamed directly to the Dify workflow.

### Data Security

- All requests are made directly from your Dify instance to the specified URL.
- No data is transmitted to third-party servers except the URL you specify.
- The plugin does not log or store any request or response data.

### Third-Party Services

The plugin makes requests to URLs specified by you. Please review the privacy policies of those services separately.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available in the plugin repository.
